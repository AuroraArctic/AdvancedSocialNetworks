# Matrices and Beta centrality

## Matrix Algebra

### Adding two matrices

The matrices X and Y indicate the ties for 2 different network relations (e.g. communication and friendship network) for the same set of 5 actors (a,b,c,d,e), shown in the image below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.cap="Two networks with same nodes", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/05-Matrices and Beta centrality/Untitled.png")
```

Suppose we want to sum $X+2Y$ to get $Z$. Considering their adjacency matrix, we get:

$$
X+2Y = Z
$$

$$
\left(  
\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right)+2
\left(  
\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right) = 
\left(  
\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 3 & 1 & 2 & 2\\
3 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 3 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\
2 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 1 \\
2 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$

### Cell Multiplication

Suppose we want to compute $XY$. Considering the adjacency matrices $X$ and $Y$, we get: 

$$
\left(  
\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right)\times
\left(  
\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right) = 
\left(  
\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
This equals to the adjacency matrix of two-steps paths from nodes in $X$ to nodes in $Y$.

```

### Matrix Multiplication of different matrices

Suppose the two matrices represent the flights and trains from a place to another. Then we can imagine the next scenarios:

- From point A to point A
- From point A to point B
- From point B to point B

## Bonacich Beta Centrality

Imagine there can be a repeated influence, such that it spreads on two or more steps. The image below represents some of the one, two, three and four steps paths inside the network:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.pos='h!', out.width='60%', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/05-Matrices and Beta centrality/Untitled 3.png")
```

$$
R = \sum^\infty_{k=1}(\beta^{k-1}X^k) = X+\beta X^2+\beta^2 X^3+\dots
$$
The terms in the Bonacich equation are powers of the adjacency matrix. The $(i,j)$ cell of the $k$th power of an adjacency matrix gives the number of walks of length $k$ from $i$ to $j$. This formula gives the number of walks of all lengths that join every pair of nodes, weighted by the $\beta$ values. 

Imagine there can be a repeated influence and we want to capture popularity (i.e. being connected to many popular people). By looking at one single step, we get that node $d$ has beta centrality $\beta*(1+1+1+3)$, which represent the number of nodes that neighbours can reach. We then add an additional term $\beta^2$, multiplied for the number of nodes each neighbour can reach in two steps. 

If a node has a high beta centrality score, it means there are many short walks connecting the node to all others and therefore a strong possibility of influencing others (or being influenced).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.pos='h!', out.width='30%', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/05-Matrices and Beta centrality/Untitled 4.png")
```

Given the matrix $X$, we have the adjacency matrix of nodes $A$,$B$, $C$ and $D$. We can compute all the two-steps adjacency paths and so on (i.e. $X^2, X^3, X^4,\dots$). We could compute the beta centrality of $a$ in the previous net by summing them up:

$$
c_B(A) = 2+5+10+23+48+\dots
$$

Instead of just summing them, we could insert the beta $\beta$ term which reduces the importance of the paths that necessitate of multiple steps: when $\beta$ is small, only immediate friends matter, while for high $\beta$, the global network structure matters. If positive, nodes have higher centrality when they have edges to other central nodes, while if negative they have higher centrality when they have edges to less central nodes. 

*Note: When selecting negative $\beta$, centrality scores themselves can be negative, implying that an actor would be better off not having any connections. It is possible to think of situations in which this could occur but these are rare, and in those cases it is probably better to increase the value of $\beta$ to eliminate negative scores.*

$$
c_B(i) = XI+\beta X^2I+\beta^2X^3I+\dots
$$

By choosing, for example, $\beta = 0.1$, the beta centrality of $A$ becomes:

$$
c_B(A) = 1*2+0.1*5+0.01*10+0.001*23+0.0001*48+\dots
$$

In the end, we get for each node (only considering $a,b,c,d$):

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Node} & \textbf{Beta Centrality} & \textbf{Norm} \\ \midrule
A             & 0.9747                   & 0.26          \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Beta Centrality with \beta value 0.1}
\label{tab:my-table}
\end{table}

We could change the beta value to 0.2 and obtain:
