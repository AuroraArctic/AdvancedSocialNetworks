# Reciprocity and transitivity

## Dyads

### Dyad census

With **dyad census**, we count how many mutual, asymmetric and null dyads there are in the network. By looking at this network, there are:
    
- mutual dyads: $4$;
- asymmetric dyads: $4$;
- null dyads: $6\cdot 5/2 - 8 = 7$ (removing all links, counting mutual dyads one time).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.pos='h!', out.width='50%', fig.cap="Example of directed network"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/12-Reciprocity and transitivity/Untitled.png")
```

<aside>
    ðŸ’¡ *Get the total dyads available as $n(n-1)/2$ and then remove the total amount of dyads actually existing (sum mutual and asymmetric's).*

</aside>

*Given the density, what would be the expected dyad census?*

- Mutual dyads: $d*d$;
- Asymmetric dyads: $2d*(1-d)$;
- Null dyads: $(1-d)(1-d)$;

In total, if all dyads existed in the network, the density would be: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
d \cdot d+2d\cdot (1-d)+(1-d)(1-d)&= d\cdot(d+1-d)+(1-d)\cdot(d+1-d) \\
&= d+1-d = 1
\end{aligned}
$$

### Reciprocity

*Is there more reciprocity in the network than by chance?*

There are two indexes for computing reciprocity:

- Compute the number of mutual dyads in the network and compare it for the total amount of possible mutual dyads ($2 \cdot mutual + asymmetric$):
    
    $$
    \frac{2\cdot M}{2\cdot M+A}
    $$
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ *In the previous example, we would get $2\cdot4/(2\cdot4+4) = 8/12 = 0.667$.*
    </aside>
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ *Suppose that the previous network doesn't have reciprocal edges, then reciprocity would be $0/(0+8) = 0$, because the index of reciprocity would be $2\cdot 0/(2\cdot 0+A) = 0$.
    If instead all edges are mutual, then the highest reachable value is 1, because $2\cdot M/(2\cdot M+A) = 2M/(2M) = 1$.*
    </aside>
                                                                                                      
- Considering the density, we would obtain the reciprocity index by:

    $$
    \frac{2\cdot M}{2\cdot M+A} = \frac{2d\cdot d}{2 d\cdot d+2d\cdot(1-d)} = \frac{d}{d+(1-d)} = d
    $$

### On R

```{r}
mat6<-matrix(c(0,0,0,1,0,0,
               0,0,1,0,0,0,
               0,1,0,0,0,0,
               1,1,1,0,1,1,
               0,0,1,1,0,1,
               0,0,0,0,1,0),6,6, byrow=T)

# Dyad Census
sna::dyad.census(mat6, g=NULL)

# Reciprocity index
# Like edgewise but multiplied for m/(m+a)
sna::grecip(mat6,measure="dyadic")

# Reciprocity index
# Edgewise (like we have seen before)
sna::grecip(mat6,measure="edgewise")

# Density
sna::gden(mat6)

# With igraph
library(igraph)
mat6i<-graph_from_adjacency_matrix(mat6,mode=c("directed"),diag=F)
igraph::reciprocity(mat6i)

igraph::edge_density(mat6i)

par(mar=c(0,0,0,0))
gplot(as.network(mat6, directed =  T),
     displaylabels=TRUE, 
     arrowhead.cex = 1, 
     edge.col = "grey70",
     gmode='digraph',
     vertex.cex = 1.5,
     label.cex = 0.7)
```

## Triads


### Triad Census

According to the Davis and Leinhardt triad census, there are 16 ways to arrange a triad. The `sna` library on R helps to count how many of them there are in a network. 

```{r}
mat6<-matrix(c(0,0,0,1,0,0,
               0,0,1,0,0,0,
               0,1,0,0,0,0,
               1,1,1,0,1,1,
               0,0,1,1,0,1,
               0,0,0,0,1,0),6,6, byrow=T)

# Triad census
sna::triad.census(mat6)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.pos='h!', out.width='50%', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/12-Reciprocity and transitivity/Untitled 3.png")
```

By considering the code output and the triad census legend, we could focus for instance on 111U triad and try to detect them:

- $a_1, a_4, a_6$
- $a_1, a_4, a_2$
- $a_1, a_4, a_3$
- $a_2, a_4, a_5$
- $a_3, a_5, a_6$

### Transitivity

In order to know whether a network is transitive, we can compare the transitivity computed through `gtrans()` with the density of the network. Transitivity is computed as the ratio between a dyad and the number of dyads between these two nodes plus the number of tryads there are. 

```{r}
sna::gtrans(mat6)
sna::gden(mat6)
```
