With respect to the considered level of analysis, there are some measures that can be computed for each of them.  

## Degree centrality

### Directed Network

Consider a direct network, whose adjacency matrix is not symmetric. The In degree indicates the popularity of a node, while the out degree indicates its connection with other nodes.

This degree centrality can be normalized to get the proportion of outcoming/incoming connections for each node, by dividing the in/outdegree by the total number of people remaining ($n-1$, or the maximum possible connections that a node could have):

### Undirected Network

In this case, the in-degree and the out-degree are the same, since we do not distinguish the type of connections. It can be considered as a double arrow pointing to both sides.

## Density and average degree

### Directed Network

$$
Density = \frac{\text{Number of ties}}{\text{Number of possible ties}} =\frac{\text{Number of ties}}{n(n-1)} 
$$

The number of possible ties, without considering self-loops, equals $n(n-1)$. The number of ties equals the sum of the adjacency matrix. 

<aside>
💡 *For instance, by considering the Friends network, we can say that there are 11 ties and 6 people, so the density equals $D = 11/(6*5) = 11/30 = 0.367$*

</aside>

This number indicates the percentage of direct connections between nodes inside the network. 

### Undirected Network

In this case, the number of ties can be obtained by doubling the sum of half-matrix, since it is symmetric. The number of possible ties in this case is divided by two, since it is symmetrical and $(a,b) = (b,a)$:

$$
Density = \frac{\text{Number of ties}}{\text{Number of possible ties}} =\frac{\text{Number of ties}}{n(n-1)/2} 
$$

<aside>
💡 *In the Simpsons example, the density equals $D = 18/(10*9/2) = 18/45 = 0.4$*

</aside>

### Average Degree

Related to directed network, the average indegree equals the sum of the in-degree or out-degree over the total number of nodes inside the network: 

<aside>
💡 In the Friends example, the average in-degree is $11/6 = 1.833$, while the out-degree is $11/6 = 1.833$.

</aside>

By considering the normalized degree, we discover that it equals the density of the network, because we initially divide by the maximum connections possible ($n(n-1)$), and then we divide everything by the total number of nodes ($n$), while the normalized degree is computed by dividing the degree by $n-1$. 

### Importance of density

The Density is useful whenever we need to compare networks, both of the same or different sizes. In particular, the bigger, the more important density becomes to evaluate its cohesiveness. 

Notice that a bigger network makes it harder to have a bigger density than a smaller one. Comparing the density of networks of different sizes can be challenging. It would be better to compare average degrees but notice that **by increasing the network size and the average degree, the density reduces.** 

## Degree-centralization

**Centralization** is a question about how central some nodes are compared to other nodes, it is a characteristic of the network itself. It's related to the distribution of the centrality inside the network, while centrality is more related to the individual sphere of the nodes. 

<aside>
💡 *The least centralized network is a ring structure, where everyone is connected to the previous and following node (in this case the centralisation is 0). 
The most centralized network is an ego one, where one node is connected to everyone and no one else is connected to nodes different from the ego (in this case the centralisation measure is far from 0).*

</aside>

Centralisation may indicate the status of some nodes inside a network. 

### Undirected Network

By taking the maximum degree inside the network, for each node, we subtract its degree to this maximum, in order to get its centralisation. The centralisation for the degree is then obtained by summing all these centralisations.

<aside>
💡 *Note that the maximum number of connections we could build in a centralized network is $n-1$. In a decentralized network, if everybody has the same number of connections, the centralisation will always be 0, since the maximum will be the same for every node.*

</aside>

![Untitled](02-Basic%20Measures%20f757e965ace349928107476b67d3f567/Untitled.png)

By considering the range between the least and the most centralized ($0-12$), the centralisation can be finally computed by dividing the centralisation for the degree by the maximum centralisation value possible.

<aside>
💡 *In the example above, it would be $5/12$.*

</aside>

The general formula for the centralisation is the following: 

$$
Centralisation = \frac{\sum (\max-degree_i)}{(n-1)(n-2)}
$$

### Directed Network

In this case, we detain both in and out-degree centralisation. 

$$
In-Centralisation = \frac{\sum (\max_{in}-\text{in-degree}_i)}{(n-1)^2}
$$

$$
Out-Centralisation = \frac{\sum (\max_{out}-\text{out-degree}_i)}{(n-1)^2}
$$

<aside>
💡 Still, if we consider the Friends network, we notice that related to the out-degree centralisation, the network is kind of centralized on Rachel, which is talkative with everybody:

</aside>

$$
Out-C = \frac{(5-1)+(5-0)+(5-1)+(5-5)+(5-3)+(5-1)}{5^2} = \frac{19}{25} = 0.76
$$

<aside>
💡 Related to the in-degree instead, the network is decentralized. By thinking about how is more popular than other characters, nobody is the true main star of the show, despite Ross is quite less cited by other people. This means that everybody is as popular as everybody else. It is not perfect yet actually, because of Ross.

</aside>

$$
In-C = \frac{(2-1)+5*(2-2)}{5^2} = \frac{1}{25} = 0.04
$$

### Experiment

*How fast a group could make decisions together?*

Each subject was given a card, with 5 symbols from a set of 6. Each symbol appeared on 4 of the 5 cards, except for one. The group was asked to find the common symbol in the shortest time possible. 

The subjects communicated by writing messages that could be passed through slots in the walls of the cubicles. Four structures were proposed:

- **ring structure:** no consistent pattern of organisations, since subjects sent messages only when receiving or work out the answer themselves;
- **straight line:** most of the time the answer was sent out by the individual in the most central position;
- **cross figure:** the peripheral sent information to the center, where answered arrived and were sent out.
- **t-figure:** the most central figure got all the information and sent the answer. Slower than the cross, but still working.

The most efficient structure is the T-figure. During the experiment, the person in the middle in the cross figure didn't understand the experiment at all, therefore the information was useless. It's the classical structure with the team leader that commands the actions to take. It actually depends on the leadership ability of the central node, otherwise there is no learning. 

The efficiency is given by the velocity and availability to communicate. Simple things benefit from the decentralized problems, whereas complex problems benefit from the centralized option, since the divide et impera organisation makes everything more efficient. 

Evaluation:

- satisfaction: ring structure;
- less errors: T-figure;
- like: ring-structure;
- at least one error: cross and T-figure

**Aim: find a balance between efficiency and satisfaction.**
