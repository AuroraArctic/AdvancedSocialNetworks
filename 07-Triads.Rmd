# Triads and structural holes


*Aim: Focus on the individual level, in particular on triads (groups of three people).*  

## Social Capital

> *Social structure is a kind of **capital** that can create for certain individuals or groups a competitive advantage in pursuing their ends. Better connected people enjoy higher returns.
‚Äî- Burt, 2000*

> 
- **Social capital:** seen as social relations and networks;
- Capital: can be financial, human, cultural etc. We can define also who owns it;
- **Competitive Advantage**: it means that who detains it has some benefits; whenever there are no more benefits related to a relationship, we talk about social liabilities. Benefits tend to have a positive effect on the entire network (i.e. tautology).

- Individuals benefits from social capital
    
    > *friends, colleagues, and more general contacts through whom you
    receive opportunities to use your financial capital and human capital
    ‚Äî- Burt, 1992*
    > 
    
- Groups benefit from social capital, where shared goals include the sharing of beliefs and norms;
    
    > *Social capital flows from the endowment of mutually respecting and
    trusting relationships which enable a group to pursue its shared goals
    more effectively than would otherwise be possible

        engaged in for other purposes

## General Balance Theory

*Imagine two people, Stan and Kyle, supposing that the first is into Trump and the second into Biden. Suppose they're friends but they have opposite opinions about politics. What could happen next? Try to convince each other and maintain the friendship or End the relationship;*

</aside>

In case relationships are ended whenever we meet differences, we talk about **social selection**. The issue here is that echo chambers may rise, leading to groups of people that share the same knowledge over and over again.

Instead, whenever we change our minds by interacting with others and dialoguing pacifically, we talk about **social influence or contagion**. 

## Heider's Balance Theory

It's about the attitude of people in groups of three. This theory considers triads instead of dyads, as in the previous general theory.  

<aside>
üí° *Suppose we're friends with someone that hates one of our friends. It may happen in one of the following cases to bring everything into balance:
- End the relationship with one of the two;
- Make them get along.*

</aside>

According to this theory is both possible social selection and social influence, such that opposition groups are more strongly differentiated from each other.

## Granovetter's Strength of Weak Ties

> *Weak ties provide people with access to information and resources
beyond those available in their own social circle; but strong ties have
greater motivation to be of assistance and are typically more easily
available.
‚Äî- Granovetter, 1983*
> 

In this theory, we do not focus on positive/negative ties, but on their strength. Let's think about forbidden triads, defined as those triads where there's a person that is strongly related to two people. 

<aside>
üíÅÔ∏è Proposition: If there are 2 strong ties between 3 people, then there will also be at least a weak tie between the others. Therefore, they know each other, despite not being good friends. This theory is based on a probabilistic assumption, therefore it may not happen all the time.

</aside>

A **forbidden triad** is defined as a combination of two strong ties and a missing tie that links the missing two nodes. 

Consider the following example, we can detect three communities, with no structural bridge with strong ties. Weak ties are important because of the cross social circles to get unique information. This means that information is spread between social circles via weak ties.

```

> *these clumps / [strong ties networks] could not, 
in fact, being connected to one another at all were
 it not for the existence of weak ties.
‚Äî- Granovetter, 1973*

## Simmel and triads

A relation between people in a dyad is of limited interest since it refers to two people. The social dynamics becomes evident when referring to three people: assuming equal individual power of (A, B and C), two actors (A and C) can join forces against a third party (B) and therefore build coalitions to force the third party (Simmel Theory).

## Coleman and closure

According to **Coleman's closure theory**, high density among people creates group pressure. Closure ensures that group norms are reinforced (joined control against freeriding, anti-social behaviour, etc.). This enforces trust and reduces costs of monitoring and transaction costs (tacit knowledge).  In general, closure is a broader normative order within which the individual can optimise performance.

## Burt's Structural Holes

Under a selfish and individualistic perspective, Burt's Structural Holes theory is applied. 

<aside>
üí° *By considering the three networks and nodes A, B and C, Coleman's closure theory states that A is in a better position because of the trust enabled by nodes in the network. Whereas Burt's theory prefers C since we maximize the relationships and resources received by nodes that must pass through C to communicate.*

```

Betweenness centrality is relevant because it is about the flow of resources between people we're connected to. In this case, C has the highest betweenness centrality, while A has the lowest. We can summarize previous theories through:

1. Simmel: No control over ego by others;
2. Betweenness: power overflow of information and resources;
3. Granovetter: access to unique information.

### Gould and Fernandez's Brokerage Positions

In this example, we look at gatekeepers, by focusing on different inputs and outputs. According to Gould and Fernandez, there are different brokerage positions:

- coordinator: interaction between members of the same group;
- gatekeeper: from an external group, it passes information to its group;
- representative: diffuses knowledge from its group to another;
- cosmopolitan: mediates as outsider members of the same group;
- liaison: interaction between different groups.

## Krackhardt's Simmelian Ties

Krackhardt's disagrees with both Coleman and Burt's theories. According to Krackhardt's, the node in the middle has to satisfy expectations of both groups, which brings node B in the previous networks in a difficult situation. This means that B is in the worst position possible because of the social tension it may encapsulate. 

<aside>
üí° *In his example of a Silicon Valley company, he created a friendship network, establishing work position according to the color: manager, pro-union, anti-union and silent positions. In the example, Chris is the most central person and everybody will listen to him. Why? Because he belongs to the pro-union position community, but all the anti-union position workers are his friends. Instead of being at the centre of the attention, Chris became silent because of the closeness to two different groups.*

## Small worlds and key players

### Six degrees of separation

According to Milgram's experiment in 1967, some people were randomly selected in Nebraska and they should send a letter or a package to someone they know in Boston. They can only use people they know on a first-name basis. The average path for the received package was 5.5, but only a few were actually reached, that's why they choose the average and not the actual value. 

### Small World Effect

In society, there's a high level of clustering, especially when the degrees of separation is that low. Whenever we have a lower geodesic distance within the same cluster, with few nodes, we may want to connect these small communities with some ties: in this case, the average distance reduces. 

A few changes in where we place ties makes some connected clusters into a small world where anybody can reach anybody else in a few steps.

```

### Keyplayers

Information only reaches the direct contacts of a person.

<aside>
üí° We want to reach as many people as possible and we can choose the persons to which we can communicate the information. Who would we choose?
1 person: 7
2 persons: 9, 4 
3 persons: 12, 2, 16, to reach everyone except for 18
4 persons: 12, 42 16, 18
We're trying to choose non redundant links to reach as many nodes as possible. 
What if we remove these nodes? Will we still be able to reach them all? Without 9, 7 and 4, we will have three clusters, guided by 12, 2 and 16.
